    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Iain Roach and im from Anchorage Alaska.  I hobbies include playing soccer, videogames and dungeon and dragons.
        Currently I want to make games that I would be proud of and that other people can enjoy.
        I hope to solidify my understanding of html and web based practices to make me more well rounded for when I graduate from RIT.
        I am a second year Game Design and Development major at RIT and even though the covid pandemic has been present throughtout my time at RIT I don't regret a thing had have met a lot of wonderful people here. 
        I would like to be able to enter the game industry right away when I graduate.
