<h2>Quote</h2> 

<blockquote><q>An imperfect masterpiece, a game well ahead of its time, 
    a beautiful tapestry of a global campaign consisting of a hundred 
    carefully linked scenarios, perfectly balanced tactical combats presenting 
    puzzle after puzzle, an immersive ongoing story, and the feeling that while 
    you are playing it, you are also part of this world. I believe we played this 
    beauty for at least a 150 hours, and every minute was well spent.</q> -- <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2667682/gloomhaven">CooperativeCake (boardgamegeek.com/thread/2667682/gloomhaven)</a></blockquote>
